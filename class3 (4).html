    <p><b> Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as Narendra Nath Datta </b>, was born in an affluent family
         in Kolkata on 12 January 1863. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a successful attorney with interests in a
          wide range of subjects, and his mother,<big>Bhuvaneshwari Devi</big> , was endowed with deep devotion, 
          strong character and other qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, 
          gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated from<i>Calcutta University</i> , 
          he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects, especially Western <s>2000</s>
          philosophy and history. Born with a yogic temperament, he used to practise
           <dfn>meditation even from his boyhood</dfn>, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for some time. </p>
